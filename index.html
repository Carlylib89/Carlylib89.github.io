 <div class="jamesbridle width-20"> James Bridle</div>
    
 <div class="anna width-50"><b>Anna</b> <br>Do you ever feel like you’re living, not in the wrong place, but in the
        wrong time? Like something occurred, or is going to occur, right here, just down this street, but you’ve missed 
        it or you’re going to miss it and there’s no going back or forwards? Do you get FOMO for the future?</div>
   
 <div class="setting-text width-75">Anna was studying at the Technical University, a visiting scholar. She specialised in
     remote sensing and urbanism. Something about uncovering the patterns of the city using satellites and infrared 
     cameras. She didn’t like talking about it except when she got drunk, and then it was all she could talk about. </div>
 
 <div class="george width-50"><b>George</b> <br>FOMO?</div>

 <div class="anna width-50"><b>Anna</b> <br>Fear of missing out. But, like, not for right now, but for the future.</div>

 <div class="setting-text width-75">I looked up at her. She hadn’t been herself for a while, it felt like. When I met her, back in 
    the summer, she’d been drunk most of the time. So had I. The bars, the beach, the islands. It was a good summer. But when 
    term started again I’d seen less and less of her, snatching the odd coffee here and there in the cafeteria, sometimes 
    wandering up to the square for beers. She’d texted me for a drink the month before, and insisted on asking me loads of questions 
    about machine learning - something she’d been working on with a partner from another department, closer to mine. I’d explained 
    some of the principles, the lay of the land. </div>

 <div class="george width-50"><b>George</b> <br>People have been trying to do this for a few decades, but it’s only in the last five they’ve 
        got really good. Massive neural networks, using all the data on the web, and all the processing power on the network. That’s 
        why Facebook and Google are really good at this. They’ve got all of the information and all of the power. Facebook knows what 
        two billion faces look like, and owns six datacentres.  Google has three times that number. They’re using neural nets for 
        tagging photos, translating languages, even making music. They’re like electronic brains.</div>

 <div class="anna width-50"><b>Anna</b> <br>So you feed in all this information, and the system, like, reads it, and builds a model of what it sees? 
    And then it can make inferences from that model? So if you show it lots of pictures of cats, and lots of pictures of dogs, it can 
    recognise the difference between cats and dogs?</div>

 <div class="george width-50"><b>George</b> <br>Yeah, that’s one thing you can do with it. But you can put in any kind of data, not just images. 
        Statistics, designs, formulae, functions - anything you can express in maths, in ones and zeroes. It doesn’t really discriminate.</div>

 <div class="anna width-50"><b>Anna</b> <br>But it’s predictive, right? she asked.</div>

 <div class="george width-50"><b>George</b> <br>Well, sort of. It can come up with new outputs, but they’re always some variant of what you’ve put in. 
    It can’t just make stuff up, out of nothing.</div>

 <div class="setting-text width-75">I got the impression she understood, but she didn’t seem very satisfied. That evening she’d come to our local bar with a 
    sheaf of print-outs, big ones, A3 and A2, folded and scored with markings. She’d put them down between us and started drinking. She looked 
    tired and very, very excited at the same time.</div>

 <div class="anna width-50"><b>Anna</b> <br>So, she said.</div>

 <div class="anna width-50"><b>Anna</b> <br>So. We finally got the network running, the big one I told you about.</div>

 <div class="george width-50"><b>George</b> <br>I didn’t know what she was talking about, and it showed.</div>

 <div class="anna width-50"><b>Anna</b> <br>You know. The landscape reader.</div>

 <div class="george width-50"><b>George</b> <br>I blanked, and she grimaced.</div>

 <div class="anna width-50"><b>Anna</b> <br>Jesus, you must have been drunk. OK.</div>

 <div class="setting-text width-75">She started drawing on the empty side of one of the papers. Lines of nodes, circles with letters in them, 
    connected by lines. Arrows going in one side, arrows out the other side. A neural network. Plus little cartoons of satellites and houses.</div>

 <div class="anna width-50"><b>Anna</b> <br>We’re working with archeology and maths, she said.</div>

 <div class="anna width-50"><b>Anna</b> <br>Maths is the collaborator; archeology is the client. We’ve been looking at aerial maps from before the 
    war, when the air force did a bunch of surveys of the city and the countryside, and then there’s more aerial surveys from the 60s and 70s, 
    and from the 80s onwards you’ve got LandSat, GeoEye, a bunch more satellites coming in. Loads and loads more data. Archeology are looking 
    for new dig sites, I was looking at the road planning - but I’ve got most of this historical stuff on file. Archeology figured that if we
    looked at enough of that imagery the right way, we could find new sites. Places that had been overlooked, places only visible from the air.</div>

 <div class="george width-50"><b>George</b> <br>She saw me frown.</div>

 <div class="anna width-50"><b>Anna</b> <br>They’ve been doing this for ages. Have you heard of shadow sites?</div>

 <div class="george width-50"><b>George</b> <br>I shook my head.</div>

 <div class="anna width-50"><b>Anna</b> <br>Shadow sites are places that are only visible from the air because they’re so low to the ground. 
    Walls that have weathered down for millennia, maybe all that’s left is a few inches high. Imagine you’re walking through the desert, 
    and it’s just miles and miles of rock and sand. The sun’s bouncing every which way and you can’t see a thing. Now imagine you’re a 
    thousand - or five hundred thousand - feet up. At dawn and dusk the low sun catches the tops of those walls and boom - suddenly these 
    straight lines appear. You can see the outlines of everything.</div>

 <div class="anna width-50"><b>Anna</b> <br>And we can do way more than that, she said.</div>

 <div class="anna width-50"><b>Anna</b> <br>We can use interference, thermal infrared, microwave - we can see what the ground is made of, 
    and what’s underneath it. So if the ground has been disturbed, or something’s been buried, it pops right out. In Egypt, they’ve been
    finding all these new tombs using synthetic aperture radar. In Belize, they found a whole city they didn’t know about, right under 
    the trees, with LiDAR.</div>

 <div class="george width-50"><b>George</b> <br>Jungles, deserts, I said.</div>

 <div class="george width-50"><b>George</b> <br>What has this got to do with the city?</div>

 <div class="george width-50"><b>George</b> <br>I waved a beer bottle around.</div>

 <div class="george width-50"><b>George</b> <br>Everything here’s been turned over a million times. There’s nothing just lying about on 
    the surface just waiting for you to come pick it up.</div>

 <div class="anna width-50"><b>Anna</b> <br>That’s what this is for, she said, jabbing at the diagram.</div>

 <div class="anna width-50"><b>Anna</b> <br>We’ve been using a neural network to explore the images. To find hidden patterns over time. 
   Things that you can’t see, that nobody can see, unless you see how a machine sees: through time, through all kinds of different data.</div>

 <div class="george width-50"><b>George</b> <br>But, I said, squinting.</div>

 <div class="george width-50"><b>George</b> <br>That network is massive. You’ve got, what, three hidden layers? And what’s the dimensionality?</div>

 <div class="anna width-50"><b>Anna</b> <br>Four, she said.</div>

 <div class="george width-50"><b>George</b> <br>I looked blank again.</div>

 <div class="anna width-50"><b>Anna</b> <br>Yeah, I know. We had to ask the university in Geneva to use one of their supercomputers. Some kind of
 deal for them coming over here next summer. But this is the point. Nobody has built one this big for this stuff before. I don’t know anyone
 who’s even tried to do urban data plus historical data plus climate, hydrological, social, political…</div>

 <div class="george width-50"><b>George</b> <br>Climate? Social and political?</div>

 <div class="anna width-50"><b>Anna</b> <br>These things are input agnostic, right. You said you can give it anything in numbers. We started 
   with just the aerial photos, the city over the last few decades. Then we added the satellite data: interferometry, elevation, buried 
   watercourses from SAR. And then we put in the meteorological data: rainfall, pressure, temperature fluctuations. And the social history: 
   timelines of the various political parties, voting records, immigration pat-terns… basic shit. But look, that’s not what I came to tell 
   you. I wanted to show you what came out.</div>

 <div class="setting-text width-75">She turned over one of the sheets of paper and unfolded it. It was a map of Athens, with the sea at the 
   bottom, and the city sprawling up to the edges of the mountains. At long oblique angles, the city was scored with black lines, rectangles 
   stretching from the southwest to the northeast, thickening out to the northeast and blurring into the next set of lines.</div>

 <div class="anna width-50"><b>Anna</b> <br>We overlaid the true colour outputs onto a contemporary map, but this is the equivalent of one 
   of those shadow sites I told you about. These things are man-made: they’re structures.</div>

 <div class="george width-50"><b>George</b> <br>Structures? These are buildings? But they’re huge. Nobody ever built anything like this. And when?</div>

 <div class="setting-text width-75">She pulled another one out. This was in false colour - all bright greens and reds - and apart from the yellowish 
   circle of mountains, the city seemed to have disappeared. Between the rectangles was just flat, dark grey, while the structures themselves were 
   olive-brown and peach. Around them, to the north and east, ran a new line, a thin curve of bright pink, broken in a few places with notches and 
   what looked like gates.</div>

 <div class="anna width-50"><b>Anna</b> <br>Look, she said.</div>

 <div class="anna width-50"><b>Anna</b> <br>This is thermal and shortwave infrared, together with some natural green. We’ve got plants here - 
   all over the structures - but everything else is water, pretty much. That ridge doesn’t show up in the shadows because it’s just under the waterline.</div>

 <div class="george width-50"><b>George</b> <br>I don’t understand, I said.</div>

 <div class="george width-50"><b>George</b> <br>You’re saying the city used to be flooded?</div>

  <div class="anna width-50"><b>Anna</b> <br>Well, that’s what it looks like, but these water levels are all wrong. The water was never this high, not 
   since the last ice age, and there weren’t settlements here then. Hell, there weren’t settlements anywhere then, not like this. These look like canals. 
   But the height differentials are crazy, you’ve got blocks and blocks here, like skyscraper-size blocks, or container ships. Like a port, but they’re 
   not shaped like ships. These are towers. And that ridge, it’s too sharp to be mountains, it’s some kind of wall. We’re looking at a city, right? But 
   it’s been inundated. It must have taken years, decades. That’s a sea wall: with locks and gates to keep the water back. But it wasn’t enough in the 
   end. The water came over. And the buildings - they must have figured out how to grow them, like plants.</div>

 <div class="setting-text width-75">She put down the map, and rolled another cigarette, lit it, and blew the smoke out.</div>

 <div class="anna width-50"><b>Anna</b> <br>We asked for an extrapolation from the data, but we didn’t specify the direction. We thought we would get a map 
   of the past, but this… this is a map of the future.</div>
